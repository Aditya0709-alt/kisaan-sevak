## Introduction

- Precision farming, also known as precision agriculture, is a farming management approach that uses technology and data to optimize crop yield, reduce waste and improve overall efficiency.
- In precision farming, farmers use various technologies like GPS, remote sensing, drones, and sensors to collect data about their crops, soil, and weather conditions. 
- This data is analyzed using various software tools to provide actionable insights that help farmers make informed decisions about crop management.
- India has a large and growing population, which is expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2050. This means that there will be increasing demand for food, which will require farmers to produce more food while also facing constraints such as limited land, water and other resources. 
- Precision farming can help farmers to optimize their use of resources and increase their productivity, which will be essential for meeting India's growing food demand.

## Dataset

Kisan Call Center also known as KCC, is a toll free call center service being run by the government where farmers can call and ask their queries. Agriculture garduates and experts man these call centers. Spread across the country, on an average it receives about 500,000 calls per month or about 60-65 lakh calls per year making it very useful for any analysis.
